### Coding Challenge

## Question 1

A file transformation module API, called FTMA, would involve taking an input file and transforming it into a desired output format. The input file could be in any format such as CSV, XML, JSON, or any other text-based format, and the desired output format could be any other text-based format.

Size and performance should be considered. It should also catch abnormal behavior and give feedback during transformation.

The file transformation module should meet the following requirements:

1. Input validation: FTMA should validate the input file format and ensure that it is in the expected format. If the input file is not in the expected format, the program should provide an error message to the user.

2. Transformation rules: FTMA should allow the user to specify transformation rules that define how the input file should be transformed into the desired output format. The transformation rules could include things like renaming columns, adding new columns, filtering rows, or changing the data type of columns.

3. Output format: FTMA should allow the user to specify the desired output format, which could be any text-based format. The program should ensure that the output format is correctly formatted and that the transformed data is properly represented in the output file.

4. Error handling: FTMA should be designed to handle errors that may occur during the transformation process. For example, if the input file contains invalid data or the transformation rules are incorrect, FTMA should provide feedback to the user on what went wrong and how to fix it.

5. Performance optimization: FTMA should be optimized for performance, especially when processing large files. This could involve things like processing the input file in chunks or using parallel processing to speed up the transformation process.


## Question 2 

### Data structures

#### Exercise 1:

Given an unsorted array of integers, write a function to sort the array using the merge sort algorithm.

Example Input: [3, 1, 6, 2, 9, 5]

Example Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

#### Notes

- Use Node.js | Python
- Apply your preferred coding practice and style
- Unit test is an added advantage
- Add README
- Produce use case or class diagram for the system architecture 
- Writing design documents will attract extra points :)
